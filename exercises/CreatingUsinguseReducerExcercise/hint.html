Make sure counterReducer gets exported and also don't change its name (otherwise, the automatic checks fail)!

Don't forget that the counterReducer function will need some input (parameters) to work correctly

Dispatch action objects that have a type property (where type is 'INCREMENT', 'DECREMENT' or 'RESET')

Don't forget that useReducer(), like useState(), always returns an array with exactly two elements

One element is for reading the current state, the other element is for changing it - though it'll work differently than it does when using useState()


Solution::
In the solution, as a first step, the existing counterReducer() function is edited to accept two parameters:

A state value

A dispatched action

The values for these parameters will be provided by React since it'll be React that calls this counterReducer() function in the end (it does that when you dispatch an action).

For this task, all dispatched actions should be objects that each have a type property (which is either 'INCREMENT', 'DECREMENT' or 'RESET') - therefore, three if checks are added to the reducer to handle these different cases.

In addition, in case some unknown action should be dispatched, the unchanged state is returned:



export function counterReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
    // Todo...
  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
    // Todo...
  } else if (action.type === 'RESET') {
    // Todo...
  }
 
  return state;
}


In case the action.type is 'INCREMENT', the counter value should be increased by 1. For 'DECREMENT' it should be reduced by 1. And for 'RESET', it should be set back to 0.

As described in the task definition, the state should be an object that contains that counter value (a count property), therefore the counterReducer function is updated appropriately:



export function counterReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
    return { count: state.count + 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
    return { count: state.count - 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'RESET') {
    return { count: 0 };
  }
 
  return state;
}


With the counterReducer finished, the useReducer() Hook is added to the App component function body.

This Hook receives two main arguments:

The connected reducer function (that will be invoked whenever an action is dispatched)

The initial state value

Therefore, the App component function looks like this:



export function counterReducer(state, action) {
  /* ... */
} // code left out here for brevity - it's the same as above
 
function App() {
  React.useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });
 
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <h1>The (Final?) Counter</h1>
      <p id="actions">
        <button>Increment</button>
        <button>Decrement</button>
        <button>Reset</button>
      </p>
      <p id="counter"></p>
    </div>
  );
}


useReducer() then returns an array with exactly two elements:

The current state

A "dispatch" function that can be called to dispatch a new action

Array destructuring can be used to store these elements in separate constants or variables.

The state value is then used to output the current counter value (via {counterState.count} since the state is an object with a count property).

The dispatch function is triggered, with different action objects (with different types), when the <button>s are clicked:



import React from 'react';
 
export function counterReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
    return { count: state.count + 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
    return { count: state.count - 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'RESET') {
    return { count: 0 };
  }
 
  return state;
}
 
function App() {
  const [counterState, dispatchCounterAction] = React.useReducer(
    counterReducer,
    { count: 0 }
  );
 
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <h1>The (Final?) Counter</h1>
      <p id="actions">
        <button onClick={() => dispatchCounterAction({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>
          Increment
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatchCounterAction({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>
          Decrement
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatchCounterAction({ type: 'RESET' })}>
          Reset
        </button>
      </p>
      <p id="counter">{counterState.count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
 
export default App;
