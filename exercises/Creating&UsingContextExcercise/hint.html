For this task, you should not use props, lifted-up-state or anything like that -
instead, use React's Context API To use the Context API, you'll need to do three
main things: Create a context Provide the context value (which includes the
theme property and the toggleTheme() method) Consume the context Set the
provided context theme value dynamically - i.e., via state Use a separate
"Provider" component that wraps any children passed to it Wrap the Page
component with the Provider component (inside the App) component Solution:: In
the solution, as a first step, a new context object is created in the
ThemeContextProvider.js file. This context object is created via React's
createContext() function - it's also exported to make it available in other
files. It receives an initial (dummy) value which is an object that exposes a
theme property and an (empty) toggleTheme() method: import React from 'react';
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({ theme: 'light', toggleTheme:
() => {}, }); To provide this context to other components, in the same file, a
ThemeContextProvider component is created and exported as a default. This
ThemeContextProvider should be wrappable around other JSX code - therefore, the
special, built-in children prop is "pulled out" of the incoming props and
wrapped with
<ThemeContext.Provider>
  (a component created by React, exposed through the ThemeContext object).
  import React from 'react'; export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  theme: 'light', toggleTheme: () => {}, }); export default function
  ThemeContextProvider({ children }) { return
  <ThemeContext.Provider>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>; } This context
  should expose a dynamic (i.e., changeable) value. Therefore, React's
  useState() Hook is used to manage the theme value. As an initial value,
  'light' is chosen - this will ensure that the app starts in "light mode". In
  addition, a toggleTheme() function is added to the ThemeContextProvider
  component. This function switches the theme from 'light' to 'dark' and vice
  versa. Both the theme state and the toggleTheme() function are then grouped
  into a value object that's set as a value for the
  <ThemeContext.Provider>
    component: import React from 'react'; export const ThemeContext =
    React.createContext({ theme: 'light', toggleTheme: () => {}, }); export
    default function ThemeContextProvider({ children }) { const [theme,
    setTheme] = React.useState('light'); const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => { return prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    }); }; return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="{{" theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
    ); } To use and provide this context to all interested components, the
    <Page /> component in the App component is now wrapped with this custom
    ThemeContextProvider component: import Page from './Page'; import
    ThemeContextProvider from './ThemeContextProvider'; function App() { return
    (
    <ThemeContextProvider>
      <Page />
    </ThemeContextProvider>
    ); } export default App; Now, the context can be consumed and used by the
    Page component and descendant components of the Page component (i.e., the
    Header component in this case). In the Header component, the ThemeContext is
    imported and "read" with help of React's useContext() Hook. This allows us
    to then get access to the context's toggleTheme() function and set it as a
    value for the onClick prop of the <button>Toggle Theme</button>: import
    React from 'react'; import { ThemeContext } from './ThemeContextProvider';
    export default function Header() { const themeCtx =
    React.useContext(ThemeContext); return (
    <header>
      <h1>Demo Website</h1>
      <button onClick="{themeCtx.toggleTheme}">Toggle Theme</button>
    </header>
    ); } Finally, to adjust the look of the page, the Page component also uses
    useContext() to get access to the (dynamic) theme property. Since the goal
    is to conditionally set a 'light' or 'dark' CSS class on the
    <div id="app">
      (inside the Page component) and the theme property contains either 'light'
      or 'dark' as a value, it's the theme property value itself that can be set
      as a CSS class: import React from 'react'; import Header from './Header';
      import { ThemeContext } from './ThemeContextProvider'; export default
      function Page() { const themeCtx = React.useContext(ThemeContext); return
      (
      <div id="app" className="{themeCtx.theme}">
        <header />
